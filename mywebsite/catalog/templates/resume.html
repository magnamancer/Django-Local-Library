                <p>I'm Fenton Clawson, a recent graduate of the PhD program at the West Virginia University department of physics and astronomy. The focus of my thesis was creating a new solver for open quantum systems under cyclical driving using Floquet theory, which can be understood as the temporal analog of Bloch theory. Along the way to get that thesis, I gathered a wide array of computational and experimental knowledge and experience in both my undergraduate and graduate career. While my area of expertise is physics, I have a deep love of mathematics, spanning from calculus to combinatorics and graph theory to stochastic systems, and fulfilled requirements for a mathematics minor in undergraduate.</p>
                <p>My Experimental knowledge focuses on spectroscopy and quantum optics. I spent my undergraduate years working in labs doing resonance spectroscopy and terahertz spectroscopy, as well as designing and building circuits as necessary to facilitate experiments. Once in graduate school, I worked in an experimental quantum optics laboratory with the main focus being experiments on charged quantum dots. This work provided ample experience working on an optical table, planning and designing laser paths for multiple different experiments. Additionally, creating power supplies, creating circuits, troubleshooting electronic components with multimeters and other test equipment, and more as necessary for my day-to-day life in the lab.</p>
                <p>My computational knowledge spans a wide variety of software and languages, with a focus on scientific simulations in Python. My coding experience arguably began with creating redstone logic gates in Minecraft as a child, but really took off in high school when I gained four years worth of training in SolidWorks. In Undergraduate, I learned LabView and breadboarding in an instrumentation class, as well as MatLab for experimental data treatment and Mathematica for its excellent animations and symbolic integration capabilities. In graduate school I automated processes and components in my lab using LabVIEW connected through a DAQBoard to electronic components. I furthered my experience with solidworks by designing experimental components when necessary. I spent much of my time in graduate school constructing a solver for open quantum systems using Floquet theory, which should soon be integrated with QuTiP, an open source quantum simulation package widely used around the world.</p>
                <p>Below, you'll find some more specific examples of experience I've had in the computational and experimental realms. These are far from the limits of everything I've done, but I think they offer a good insight as to my knowledge and abilities.
